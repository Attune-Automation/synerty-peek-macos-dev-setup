# ServerTribe

*ServerTribeâ€™s mission* is to provide the community access to intuitive and
flexible open-source IT automated and orchestrated SysOps processes.

This is an *Attune Project* that contains IT automated and orchestrated
processes.

Attune is your flexible IT Automation & Orchestration solution, a
self-documenting central source of reusable proven processes, files and
backups to build and maintain your IT/OT infrastructure. Attune can be
configured to perform any process or task that a System Administrator or
Database Administrator would perform through a terminal.

The *Attune Community Edition* can be
[downloaded for free](https://www.servertribe.com/comunity-edition/)
from our [ServerTribe website](https://www.servertribe.com/). You can learn
more about Attune through [ServerTribe's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube
